# End-effector
This End effector has been made to fit the mission.

The idea was inspired by the [Japanese Shuriken](https://github.com/Ahmad7772/End-effector/blob/main/End%20effector/Japanese%20Shuriken1.jpg).

I combine two pieces of Shuriken to cover all sides and made some adjustments to fit the Robot Arm.
